# Source Code
All source code for the robot should be placed in this folder.

### Prerequisites:
  
On Linux packages should be installed as root (with `sudo`).  

OpenCV can be installed with `pip3 install opencv-python`.  
Numba can be installed with `pip3 install numba`.  
NumPy can be installed with `pip3 install numpy`, but should be installed automatically with the other libraries.  

### Usage:

The code can be run with `python3 Source/main.py`. NOTE: main.py must be run from the base directory *(./, not ./Source/)* for the Data directory to be found.
