Camera calibration directory for the mounted bottermellon camera pair after adding hot glue to the focal adjustment mechanism.
Prior to adding hot glue, we attempted to focus both cameras to optimize sharpness at around 4 meters from the camera. Focus appears acceptable in a range of about 0.5 meters to around 8 meters (but realistically resolution appears to be a bigger issue at far distances than focus)

Calibration and rectification parameters were computed with a 6x8 chessboard (internal intersection rows/cols) with squares 23.5 mm on each side.
